A small WebGL based visualizer for SLAM.


# Usage

In the terminal start a webserver to serve the index.html file. You can
use any webserver of your choice but the easiest is the following python
3 one liner.

    python3 -m http.server 8000

Now that the webserver is up, open a broser tab at `127.0.0.1:8000`.
